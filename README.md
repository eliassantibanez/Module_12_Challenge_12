# Module_12_Challenge_12
#### In this application, we describe the analysis an analyis using machine learning models, the analysis includes:

* Explaining the purpose of the analysis.
* Explaining what financial information the data was on, and what is needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables we're trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process.

## Technologies

This application uses the following libraries:
* import numpy as np
* import pandas as pd
* from pathlib import Path
* from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score
* from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
* from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced
* import warnings
* warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

---

## Installation Guide

This program will require to use sklearn, pandas, and 

The user must use the CSV datasets contained in the Resources file. 

---

## Usage
The Jupyter notebook contains the data preparation process, analysis, and explanations for both models the machine learning algo needs to understand. 

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
